# Final Project for CS237 Graphics

The assignment was to build on our knowledge of OpenGl gained throughout the quarter. We decided to create a game from the ground up. Clone this repo to play Cube Runner! See how far you can guide the player through the increasingly difficult, dynamic levels.

##Controls:

- N - New Game
- Left/Right keys: Move Player
- Up Key: God/Invincible Mode
- T - Go back to title screen

##Installation:

- Clone the repo and "Make" in the "final-project/build" directory
- Run on the correct map by 
	"./proj5 ../assets/heightmap/map-1414"
