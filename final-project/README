## Final Project for CS237 Graphics

The assignment was to build on our knowledge of OpenGl gained throughout the quarter. We decided to create a game from the ground up. Clone this repo to play Cube Runner! See how far you can guide the player through the increasingly difficult, dynamic levels.

#Controls:

N - New Game
Left/Right keys: Move Player
Up Key: God/Invincible Mode
T - Go back to title screen

#Installation:

1) Clone the repo and "Make" in the /build directory
2) Run on the correct map by "./proj5 ../assets/heightmap/map-1414"
